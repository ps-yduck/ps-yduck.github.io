<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am a full-time research associate at the [Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS)](https://lums.edu.pk/), working under the supervision of [Dr. Zafar Ayyub Qazi](https://web.lums.edu.pk/~zafar/), [Dr. Ihsan Ayyub Qazi](https://www.ihsanqazi.com/home), and [Dr. Agha Ali Raza](https://aghaaliraza.com/). My research focuses on Systems and Networking, particularly in Distributed Systems, Mobile Operating Systems, and Networked Systems. I have contributed to the development of scalable systems for LLM-powered applications and worked on understanding and addressing kernel memory performance degradation under federated learning workloads.

I graduated from LUMS in 2024 with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science. My goal is to pursue a Ph.D. in Computer Science and contribute to cutting-edge research in Systems and Networking.
